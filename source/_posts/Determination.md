I lack (but I would like to find) a relatively objective mental model for thinking about determination in practice. This post is an RFP for such a framework. I am hoping that someone may be able to point me in the right direction to gain one or ideally several, practical mental models on determination.

I hope to use this framework when talking with fellow-founders (as a framework they may adopt, if they struggle with this), when hiring new team members (as a pre-hire test/assesment), or when training existing team members (as a framework to aide coaching, and/or a framework they may adopt in self-directed learning thereafter).

<!-- more -->

I am very determined. 'Determined' is the always among the first word friends, fellow-founders, investors, coworkers, etc. use to describe me - pretty much without exception. For all the good and bad about my character, it's probably fair to say that determination goes in the positive column.

However I have never successfully translated my own determination into either **(1)** evaluating another person's determination (i.e. in a job interview) or **(2)** helping lead another person cultivate and grow their own determination (i.e. in coaching).

I have tried many times, but always failed. 

I hope to change that. I want to discover the frameworks, mental-models, and research that can help: 
* **(1)** evaluate determination (i.e. in a job interview); and perhaps more importantly help to:
* **(2)** cultivate determination in someone who wishes to build it in a practical, systematic, [deliberate-practice](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory) sort of way (i.e. as a coach). 

If you can help point me in the right direction, please do. üòä

## What is a 'Framework'?

Here, by Framework or Mental Model I mean a set of research-based practices that someone may practically act upon. Ideally a structured practice, which is (at least somewhat) objectively-observable.

Some examples of practical frameworks in other areas:

* Cultivate Self-Control? [Try these tools.](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/09/30/self-control/) 
* Clear Thinking? [This mental model will help you reason like a scientist](https://waitbutwhy.com/).
* Need to communicate better as a leader? You might try [Action Science](https://actiondesign.com/resources/readings/action-science), [NLP](https://www.amazon.com/NLP-Work-Essence-Excellence-Professionals/dp/1857885295), [Non-Violent Communication](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Marshall-Rosenberg/dp/1892005034), or other practical frameworks.
* Better Mental Health? [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) or [ACT](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841) are great, among others.
* Habit Change? The book [The Coaching Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749) has the best short-summary of practical habit change I've yet seen.
* Need better Focus? The [The Distracted Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Distracted-Mind-Ancient-Brains-High-Tech/dp/0262034948) includes practical frameworks to make it happen.
* Need to deal with stress? Then [reframe it with this mental model](https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en).

These are just off the top of my head. Each of the frameworks or mental-models above are ones that've come up in my life in the past week or so, so are top-of-mind. Most of them are well-researched (except NVC).

They work, and they are practical. 

In leadership you can use them with to **(1)** evaluate a trait in someone (i.e. in a job interview); or **(2)** help guide someone to cultivate a trait (i.e. coaching).

**I know of no such framework or practical mental-model for determination.** I would really like to find one (or better yet, several). 

I hope you can point me in a good direction.

### Self-Deception in Self-Evaluation

Finding relatively objectively-observable frameworks seems to be particularly important when it comes to determination (rather than say, basing things on someone's self-evaluation: i.e. _'how determined do you think you are?'_).

This is because most people (or more specifically, their ego) seems to have an immunity to reality when it comes to determination. Their self-evaluations are often really self-deceptions. 

When most people faced with tough challenges give up, avoiding the pain those challenges bring, they will have rationalizations ready, to keep their ego intact.

![Determination Flow](/images/Determination/determination-flow.png "Determination")

And they believe them. Even when these rationalizations completely contradict their stated-beliefs and values, they'll nonetheless jiu-jitsu rationalizations enough to justify avoiding the pain and discomfort of the challenge.

> "I have seen CEOs try to cope with the stress by drinking heavily, checking out, and even quitting. In each case, the CEO has a marvelous rationalization why it was OK for him to punk out or quit, but none them will ever be great CEOs. Great CEOs face the pain.‚Äù **‚á¢ from [Ben Horowitz, What‚Äôs The Most Difficult CEO Skill? Managing Your Own Psychology.](https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/31/what%E2%80%99s-the-most-difficult-ceo-skill-managing-your-own-psychology/)**

These rationalizations try to preserve the ego by concealing (or at least, they try to conceal) the gap between a person's: 

* (1) **Espoused Theory of Action** (what they _say_ about themselves); and 
* (2) **Theory-in-use** (what they _actually do_; despite what they say)
    
<small>_(‚á¢ see [this for summary](http://www.aral.com.au/resources/argyris.html) on Chris Argyris' work: or others on [Action Science](https://actiondesign.com/resources/readings/action-science) and [Double Loop Learning](https://fs.blog/2018/06/double-loop-learning/))_</small>

I mention this because at least to me, this gaps seems to be quite large for many people when it comes to their self-evaluation of their determination vs. their actions when faced with tough-challenges.

_(this is why I made a point of saying that others evaluate me as determined earlier, rather than evaluating myself that way)._

And since I hope to find a Determination Framework in order to...
* **(1)** evaluate determination in someone (i.e. in a job interview); or 
* **(2)** help guide someone to cultivate determination (i.e. coaching)

...any useful framework will therefore need to help make someone's **Theory-in-use** (what they **_actually do_**) apparent and relatively objective to that person. 

It will need to expose not just the invalidity of any given rationalization, but instead go deeper to make clear the behaviour of creating rationalizations itself and how this relates to (i.e. undermines) a person's determination. 

The rationalizations themselves, are not real. So kill one and another will take its place like a game of whack-a-mole.

So as a leader I really want a framework that will dig into the root. To help someone objectively see their determination in an intellecutally-honest way, and help them cultivate it.

## Known Frameworks (to me)

There are a few semi-related frameworks I already know about; again, mostly well-researched (especially Argyris).

****

#### Action Science

I've mentioned [Action Science](https://actiondesign.com/resources/readings/action-science) a few times above. It's a set of practices developed mostly by [Chris Argyris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Argyris) and [Donald Sch√∂n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sch%C3%B6n). 

It's a bit too big to summarize here. You can maybe [read this link](http://www.aral.com.au/resources/argyris.html). For our purposes here let's say that Action Science is a set of tools which help to dig beyond an Espoused Theory (what someone _say_ about themselves) and into a Theory-in-use (what they _actually do_). 

It's a great tool for leaders and organizations. Like, really great.

It is somewhat helpful because if you're going to play whack-a-mole exposing rationalizations, Action Science is at least a good way to do it.

However I'm not sure it will help me: **(1)** evaluate determination (i.e. in a job interview); **(2)** cultivate determination (i.e. as a coach).

#### Responsability Process

[Christopher Avery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcezKRhpoY) describes a [Responsability Process](https://www.amazon.com/Responsibility-Process-Unlocking-Natural-Ability/dp/099774720X) as a sequential series of progressively mature mindsets of responsability. He is likely expanding on [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove)'s similar framework for responsability in [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884).

![Responsability Process](/images/Determination/Responsibility.png "Responsability Process")

In this sense 'responsibility' and 'determination' are pretty much the same thing. Because the responsible person here will not rationalize themselves out of acting in a determined way.

It works by using [cognitive reframing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reframing) to recognize your rationalizations for what they are, then reframe the thought to something healthier (i.e. reframe your way from denial ‚á¢ through to responsability).

I (personally) love this mental-model. It's great. Like, really great. If you implement it I believe you will be happier in your life. It's that good.

I have not found it that helpful to:
* **(1)** evaluate determination (i.e. in an interview)

Though it has been somewhat helpful in:
* **(2)** cultivating determination (i.e. as a coach)

...but on #2, only somewhat. I find it extremely effective personally, but it does not seem to work well when given to others, as Avery himself points out. 

So I love this mental-model (it's probably one of the most important ones I have found in my life), but it has not proven very effective as an evaluation tool or coaching tool as I attempt to be a better leader.

#### Challenge vs. Threat Response

The [Challenge Response](http://kellymcgonigal.com/think-like-a-champion) mental-model is also a type of Cognitive Reframing. For more you can see [Kelly McGonigal's work](https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Stress-Why-Good-You/dp/1101982934). To over-simplify it's sort of just a different end-result of the reframing execise, than Avery's.

{% youtube RcGyVTAoXEU %}

Her model describes taking feelings of threat (in our context; these can overwhelm your determination) and reframing them as a challenge that will help you grow (so: positive view = better determination).

This model has been the most helpful to me in (1) evaluating (i.e. in a job interview) but asking someone to change how they think hasn't been very practical to (2) cultivate (i.e. as a coach). 

Sure, it works. But it only works if the person actually does it. Suggesting the model in 1-1's with team members typically isn't very effective, to lead to actual execution. You can't force someone.

Her [book is good](https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Stress-Why-Good-You/dp/1101982934) if you're interested in the science.

# So...

When it comes to evaluating determination (i.e. in a job interview) neither tool has really been helpful. When it comes to cultivating determination (i.e. as a coach) each can kind-of, sort-of help but only to the extent they pick-apart and dismantle rationalizations to expose them for what they are. 

But by the time you're dismantling rationalizations, playing rationalization whack-a-mole, it's often already too late. Determination has failed, and the time to either evaulate for it or to cultivate it as a leader has already past. In other words, you have failed as a leader, before the failure in determination.

I hope to find a framework (or mental-model) that can be **_proactively effective_** at the level of **determination itself** (not at the _reactive_ level of dismantling rationalizations).

## ‚á¢ So, any ideas? Can anyone point me in any good directions? 

I wanted to write that post to ask that question of my friends. Let me know what you've got. I'll close with a few quotes on determination (I just like them):

****

> The habit of failure is purely mental and is the mother of fear. This habit gets itself fixed on men because they lack vision. They start out to do something that reaches from A to Z. At A they fail, at B they stumble, and at C they meet with what seems to be an insuperable difficulty. They then cry "Beaten" and throw the whole task down. They have not even given themselves a chance really to fail; they have not given their vision a chance to be proved or disproved. They have simply let themselves be beaten by the natural difficulties that attend every kind of effort.
> .
> More men are beaten than fail. It is not wisdom they need or money, or brilliance, or "pull," but just plain gristle and bone. This rude, simple, primitive power which we call "stick-to-it-iveness" is the uncrowned king of the world of endeavour. People are utterly wrong in their slant upon things. They see the successes that men have made and somehow they appear to be easy. But that is a world away from the facts. It is failure that is easy. Success is always hard. A man can fail in ease; he can succeed only by paying out all that he has and is. It is this which makes success so pitiable a thing if it be in lines that are not useful and uplifting. **‚á¢ Henry Ford, My Life and Work**

That's the myth in the Valley...But as long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination. You're going to hit a lot of obstacles.
