Spent my day here today; itâ€™s a Buddhist temple on the far corner of Busan, which is a city on the southern tip of South Korea. Almost every temple in most Asian countries looks pretty much exactly the same as every other temple (at least every other temple within the same country), but this temple is one of the exceptions. You can read more about it here: [http://visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SIEN311_1.jsp?cid=264404](http://visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SIEN311_1.jsp?cid=264404)
