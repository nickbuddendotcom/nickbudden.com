title: Taiwan's Evolving Startup Ecosystem

The Taiwan startup ecosystem is changing for the better.

After nearly 10-years building software startups with Taiwan teams, it feels good to be able to say that. I love Taiwan and have always been committed to building teams here, but that hasn't always been easy. It's a nascent ecosystem.

Thankfully things are really looking up. There's rapid change in the Taiwan ecosystem. It's real, substantiative change. I expect a few more ups and downs, but generally I expect this positive trend to continue, and even accelerate.

That's something I'm really excited about! Over the past months I've discussed this with other Taiwan-connected founders, with Taiwanese inside and outside Taiwan, and the VC community. Today I wanted to share the content of those conversations with everyone.

<!-- more -->

It seems to be 3x mutually-reinforcing trends:

* (1) Reversing Brain-Drain
* (2) Better VC's
* (3) Experienced Mentors

# 1. Reversing Brain-Drain

***tl;dr*** more Taiwanese abroad want to come home (if they can find a good opportunity).

****

I've been connecting with Taiwanese working in overseas startup communities for years. US, Europe, Japan, China, Singapore, etc. Unfortunately, something I almost never heard from them was: ***"I want to go home."***

...at least, not unless they (a) had aging family members who needed their care or (b) they were retiring. 

For most Taiwanese abroad, the grass was always greener outside Taiwan. There were some exceptions, but not many. Most people wanted to get out, and they wanted to stay out. I think our brain-drain problem in Taiwan is worse than people want to acknowledge:

> GlobalTalent from Oxford has ranked Taiwan the highest in ‚ÄúBrain Drain‚Äù globally by 2021. The government has calculated that about 7.2% of the workforce will leave Taiwan in search of better job opportunities with the bulk of it going to China. [Berkeley](https://mdp.berkeley.edu/taiwans-brain-drain-has-caused-people-turning-heads-to-china/)

I've never understood why our startup ecosystem, government officials who support startups, and even other founders don't really acknowledge this problem. People always seem surprised when I say it's an issue...but, anyway...what's amazing is that seems to be turning around.

Today (unlike in years past) when I speak with Taiwanese abroad, they want to come home! Lots of them. Though there's still one caveat. What I've begun to hear today is *"I want to go home to Taiwan, <u>**but there's no good opportunities there**</u>."*

The desire to come home is finally there (including with many young Taiwanese), but the opportunities they'd need to do so are not. This isn't true of everyone. Some Taiwanese still want to stay abroad. But I've personally seen a very signifncant shift in the past 24-months. People want to come home.

But they don't want to work for the companies that are here. This has more to do with work culture than any other short-coming. Luckily, a maturing startup ecosystem can change this. We can offer them better opportunities. 

We're not there yet. If you're a Taiwanese abroad you've got a few companies I think care about great culture (including our company Phase, which is scaling up). But only a few.

But we're on the right track. Within a few years I believe the opportunities for Taiwanese abroad to return home, mutually reenforced by the rest of our ecosystem's development, will grow. I also think the number of Taiwanese who want to come home will continue to increase.

Taiwanese abroad are starting to bring their experience back home. This is fantastic, because that's exactly what Taiwan tech needs. Our brain drain has begun to reverse. It's flowing back home.

# 2. Better VC üí∏

***tl;dr*** we have more (and far better) early-stage VC's.

****

### What's the History?

Early-stage VC in East Asia is mostly geographically bounded.

- **Southeast Asian VC's** (Singapore et al.) have been backed by LP's who want to invest in a "Southeast Asian Emerging Economies"  thesis, for which Taiwan is typically out of mandate. 
- **Mainland Chinese VC** is off the table. Taiwan laws about Chinese investment makes it impractical (and mainland Chinese investors don't have much interest in Taiwan startups, anyway).
- **Japanese and Korean VC's** are each very inward-looking, focused on their (relatively strong) domestic startup ecosystems. They often like to say they want to act internationally, but in practice they don't (with the exception of Headline in JP). 

These are geographic cracks Taiwan has fallen through for years. We are not inside any of these existing clusters. We've needed our own domestic cluster (like Japan/Korea have), but for years there was little progress.

Which is not to say that we didn't have early stage investors in Taiwan. It's just that the ones were had were the wrong kind. This old guard was mostly (a) venture arms of local banks or (b) strategic venture arms of local corporates. 

Both have a bizarrely risk-averse venture culture for early stage VC's. Their view could be better characterised as *"how can we avoid losing money?"* rather than *"how could we potentially make lots of money?"* 

To over-simplify, this loss-aversion (rather than gain-seeking) approach wanted profitable early-stage P&L that looked like almost like a scale down version of an established corporation. Not great...

> Entrepreneurs who have run a startup know that startups are not small versions of big companies. Rather they are different in every possible way ‚Äì from goals, to measurements, from employees to culture. Very few skills, process, people or strategies that work in a startup are successful in a large established company and vice versa because a startup is a different organizational entity than a large established company. -- [Steve Blank, "A Startup is Not a Smaller Version of a Large Company"](https://steveblank.com/2010/01/14/a-startup-is-not-a-smaller-version-of-a-large-company/)

The outcome of this approach was that they backed a lot of profitable small-ish SMB's, which (if very successful) went on to become a slightly larger SMB. They were not backing "startups" as most people think of the word.

We'll skip the government run venture studio types (i.e. [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/) or [III](https://web.iii.org.tw/)). They hit it out of the park with TSMC...35-years ago. Pretty quiet ever since. I couldn't name a founder in the community I'm a part of who they've helped.

Let's skip the accelerators, too. Taiwan has a few hundred of them, but the major ones have gravitated towards backing later-stage companies, and actually have few (sometimes no) startups in their batches with any Taiwan operations or angle. They're fly-in/fly-out. Which isn't something to hold against them. It just means they're not making any sizeable dent in supporting the the local early-stage ecosystem. They're here for the LP's, not the startups.

Finally, let's skip the 'false start' VC's. By this I'm referring to the VC's who showed up in Taiwan every 1-2 years ready to *"tap into the underserved Taiwan market"* or whatnot. Really they thought it was a place to get easy LP's, as Taiwan corporates are sitting on a ton of cash they don't know what to do with.  

They soon realised that (a) the LP's were not easy and (b) dealflow in a country that doesn't have any real ecosystem is very, very hard (disconnected ecosystems don't make referrals). Or in other words, they learn it's hard.

So they give up and leave (without making any investments). Then like a revolving door, another shows up a year or two later. Repeat. So, skip them.

If you can't tell by all the categories we're skipping, there's been a lot more noise than substance in the Taiwan ecosystem in past years. So much noise...

### What's Changed?

The status quo described above went years without change. Then within the span of ~24-months, it flipped. Now we suddenly have an early-stage VC ecosystem.

First came [Hive Ventures](https://www.hiveventures.io/). This team of international-Taiwanese built and sold a company, helped lead the acquirer to a US IPO, then returned to Taiwan to support Taiwan entrepreneurs with their early-stage fund Hive.

They faced the exact same obstacles the previous VC's had faced. Their dealflow didn't come any easier, for example. But they actually cared - they really were here to help Taiwan, not just shake it until LP money fell out. So they didn't pack up and leave when it got hard. They just worked harder. 

They were the icebreakers.  

But sometime later Taiwan's [National Development Fund (NDF)](https://www.df.gov.tw/eng/) became an LP in several international funds who had a Taiwan connection (not the same funds who were doing the shaking). They picked good funds, with managers who actually spent time on the ground in Taiwan and set up teams here.

This isn't the first time they've tried this. It didn't go well the first time, but it's working this time. These VC's are putting in work and they're actually backing early-stage companies with Taiwan operations.

Besides Hive there's also [500 Global](https://500.co/), [Palm Drive Capital](https://palmdrive.vc/), [Cherubic](https://cherubic.com/), [Mucker](https://www.mucker.com/), and [Draper](https://www.draper.vc/) with teams on the ground in Taiwan today. Some don't have NDF as an LP, and came here on their own. They're quality VC's. That's an increase from about ~0.5 quality early-stage VC's 2-years ago up to ~5-6 today.

The result is that (shockingly, to anyone who's been in Taiwan a long time) we actually have a relatively mature early-stage VC ecosystem today. 

It sure changed fast.

# 3. Experienced Mentors üë©‚Äçüéì

***tl;dr*** our ecosystem has had an experience-injection

****

Startup Ecosystems grow like forrests. The first surviving tree provides shelter and seeds for the next, which then does the same, in a cycle.

What's hard is to grow your first surviving tree in a new startup ecosystem. The first successful startup whose alumni will share their experience with the next generation of founders. 

It's part of stimulating a pay-it-forward culture:

> [there's an] unspoken Valley culture that believes ‚ÄúI was helped when I started out and now it‚Äôs my turn to help others.‚Äù - [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/15/the-pay-it-forward-culture-of-startups/)

Unfortunately, the pay-it-forward culture has been lacking in Taiwan in the past.

With the notable exception of John Fan who has helped virtually everybody, for a long time. For years "John Fan" and "pay-it-forward" could have probably been listed as synonyms in Taiwan's startup dictionary. 

If you bump into John he deserves thanks.

But luckily, John no longer has to carry Taiwan startups' pay-it-forward culture exclusively on his own shoulders. Just as with VC's there has been a relatively sudden influx of experienced founders, eager to give back.

They (mostly) didn't build their companies in Taiwan. So it's new territory for them. But they're here, and they came to help.

Pay-it-forward culture is usually a chicken-and-egg problem. You've got to build successful companies (though blood, sweat, and tears) before the first experienced founders emerge. But in combination with Taiwan's Homecoming mentioned earlier, we've partially short-circuited this problem, with Taiwanese-international founders connecting into the Taiwan ecosystem as mentors.

[886 Studios](https://www.886studios.com/) comes to mind, but they're not the only ones. Though they're usually just temporary visitors, [MOX](https://mobileonlyx.com/)  has been bringing us experienced mentors (and free beer) for some time now.

# Conclusion

I think these trends will need to play out for a few more years before our ecosystem really matures, but we're certainly pointed in a great direction. 

- Multi-nat / big startups is short-term negative, long-term positive (for startups). 
- Gold Card is good but in reality we'd like to hire more from southeast asia. Trying to attract silicon valley talent into our startups doesn't make sense. What we wnat to do is attract more asia-local into our startups rather than having them join silicon valley. 

Not everything is great. 

I could just do a second post on the hiring squeeze...

Cherubic has been here...but I don't know them well so can't comment much. Same with AppWorks. 

appworks gets a lot of negative ... but personally I think they're great. 

NDF. They (I think justifably) got a lot of flack for the previous attempt at this. But...

Few extra notes...  

I think the gold card is a great program, but it's not having a big impact on startups. What would have a much bigger impact on startups would be easier visa laws on hiring talent from southeast asia.  

I remember...no local Taiwan investor...That would be a valid issue today...

#### More Experience

...groups like 886...in addittion to the companies who've scaled...



...more people want to come home
...some local companies have scaled 
...there's better capital available

...we're not talking about people who temporarily relocated to Taiwan during covid. 

...there's a squeeze on talent. 
    Our company is lucky that we're leaning into our Series A so this won't affect us as much. But it's going to be tough for some startups to raise.
    This is great in that it'll create new opportunities, and training
    But it's also dangerous bc these companies treat TW as a back-office, and as a funnel for their HQ. So there's a downside. But I think it'll be longterm positive.
    One thing that's in common with other founders is it's difficult to hire leaders...(don't know if share this)

...a few weeks ago I sat down with a Taiwanese friend who's recently moved to the Bay Area. He finds that the quality of his life much bette rin TW (maybe or maybe not share this...)



Send to hive and ask if they want me to change how I'm characterising Taiwan at all. 



In the short term this is (unfortunately) going to be a strong counter-weight to the positive trends...it's good for Taiwan in general, but it's going to hurt Taiwan startups. 

there...
